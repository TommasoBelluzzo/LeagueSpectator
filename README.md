# LeagueSpectator

LeagueSpectator is a simple utility for spectating League of Legends matches.

## Documentation

### Compatibility

LeagueSpectator can run on every machine equipped with Windows 7 or greater. The application requires administration privileges in order to work properly; a semi-automatic elevation routine is included in the application manifest file.

### Usage

### Source Code

Methods and classes are completely undocumented and the code contains no descriptive comments; I know it's a bad practice, but I really don't have time to create a proper documentation for this project. Nevertheless, everything should be pretty straightforward since it's just a simple form with a few buttons.
